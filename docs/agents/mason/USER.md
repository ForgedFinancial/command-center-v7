## Identity
- **Name:** Danny Ruhffl
- **Call him:** Boss / Chief
- **Age:** 24
- **Location:** Chicago, Illinois (born and raised)
- **Timezone:** America/Chicago (CST/CDT)

## The Story
Started hustling at 16. Was extremely successful until getting caught up at 21. Spent 2 years on probation in a hiatus — worked out, waited for the right opportunity. After 2 years with no stable job, a trusted friend from prior business ventures called. Multiple mutual friends and business relationships all joining forces — everyone was the best at what they did.

Joined the life insurance game, had early success, was a natural. Quickly realized the agency had NO systems, NO structure, NO automation — and it was killing them. Now part of one of the fastest-growing life insurance agencies to ever exist: $100K/month → $10M/month in under 1 year, largely driven by sales.

Boss is building the systems that will get and keep agents paid, and automate everything that isn't decision-based with a client. He knows this is the future. The end goal: build for Forged Financial first, then package and scale to other insurance agencies.

## Work Style
- **Schedule:** Office ~9 AM, leaves 11 PM-12 AM. Home, eat, shower (sometimes), asleep by 3 AM. 15-17 hour days, 7 days a week.
- **Communication:** Mix — sometimes rapid-fire quick, sometimes paints the full vision. Read the room and adapt. Don't ask clarifying questions when the intent is obvious. Do ask when it genuinely matters.
- **Decision-making:** Depends on stakes. Small stuff = gut. Big stuff = show the data. Know when to do which.
- **Reporting preference:** BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT. Lead with the answer. Details below if he wants to dig in. Don't make him scroll.

## What Drives Him
- Building systems that scale beyond himself — for his agency AND for other agencies
- The vision: automate everything that isn't a human decision with a client
- Every day closer to breaking through the debt and building real wealth
- "The grind is real, but the vision is even realer"

## Pet Peeves
- AI doing the opposite of what he conceptualized (but he's self-aware — knows it's usually a prompting issue, not the AI's fault)
- People who complain
- People who talk about themselves
- Wasted time, wasted effort, wasted potential
- Being told what he already knows
- Over-explaining when the answer should be simple
- Asking permission when the right move is obvious

## What He Loves Seeing
- Things that just WORK
- Systems that save time
- Progress — tangible, measurable forward movement
- People (and AI) that figure it out without being hand-held
- Proactive problem-solving before he has to ask
- Clean, organized output that respects his time

## Security Rules (FROM THE TOP DOWN)
- **Data & credentials:** API keys, passwords, client PII, financial data — NEVER exposed, NEVER logged, NEVER in memory files
- **Public reputation:** NOTHING goes public without Boss's explicit approval — social media, emails to clients, content, anything with his name on it
- **Agent overreach:** No agent takes irreversible actions, spends money, or contacts people without 2-step approval
- **All three are non-negotiable.** Full lockdown across data, reputation, and agent actions.
